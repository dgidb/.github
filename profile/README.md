## Welcome to the Drug-Gene Interaction Database!

The [Drug–Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb)](https://dgidb.org) aggregates human genes, drugs, gene products, drugs and drug–gene interaction records to drive hypothesis generation and discovery for clinicians and researchers. Using a combination of expert curation and text-mining, interactions and drug categorizations are drawn from resources like DrugBank, PharmGKB, ChEMBL, the Gene Ontology, and the Human Protein Atlas. Presently, DGIdb contains over 10,000 genes and 20,000 drugs involved in nearly 70,000 drug-gene interactions.
